# Summary

UD Swedish-Old is a treebank containing texts from Old Swedish (1225-1526). 

# Introduction

UD Swedish-Old is a treebank containing texts from the Old Swedish period, traditionally dated from 1225 to 1526. It is part of the project Swedish Diachronic Treebank, which will also treebank texts from Modern Swedish (1526-1900). The project is coordinated by Språkbanken CLARIN.

Currently, the treebank contains only one text: "Här sigx aff abotum allum skemptan mykla", a satirical text about abbots. Since the treebank is very small, there is currently only test data and no training or development data. The annotation originates from MAÞiR Trees (Språkbanken Text, 2024), where the text was annotated according to the Menotec guidelines, part of the PROIEL family of annotation guidelines/treebanks (Eckhoff et al., 2018). 

# Acknowledgments

The conversion from MAÞiR Trees to UD has been performed by Astrid Berntsson Ingelstam and Joakim Nivre, with support by Lars Ahrenberg, Gerlof Bouma, Lars Borin, Erik Magnusson Petzell, Eva Pettersson, and Sara Stymne.
