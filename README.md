# Summary

UD Swedish-Old consists of an old Swedish satirical text. The annotation is a convertion of the same text i MAÞiR Trees, originally annotated according to the PROIEL guidelines.

# Introduction

UD Swedish-Old contains old Swedish text. Currently, the treebank contains only one text: "Här sigx aff abotum allum skemptan mykla", a satirical text about abbots. Since the treebank is very small, there is currently only test data and no training or development data.
